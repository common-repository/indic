Indic transliteration for the visual editor.

== Description ==

Indic enables Indic transliteration in the visual editor. In order to use it just choose the preferred script from the dropdown in the visual editor.

The current script is saved in a cookie and it is recovered the next time you use the editor.

Behind the scenes the plugin uses the <a href="http://www.var-x.com/gamabhana/">Gamabhana library</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the `indic` folder in `/wp-content/plugins/` on your server
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which scripts are supported? =

Current only Devanagari, Bengoli, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Gurumukhi, Telugu and Urdu are supported. If you would like to help with the support of another script, please see the [web site of the Gamabhana library](http://www.var-x.com/gamabhana/) for more details and instructions.

= Indic characters doesn't show properly in my browser! =

You can find some helpful hints in [this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Enabling_complex_text_support_for_Indic_scripts "Multilingual support (Indic)").

= Where can I find which key sequence to which Indic letter corresponds? =

Have a look at the [nice table at the Gamabhana library site](http://www.var-x.com/gamabhana/keyboardhelp.html). Devanagari is used there, but the same logic applies to all other scripts.
